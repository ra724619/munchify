# Munchify - Playlists for your recipes!

## Description
Application to generate a playlist from Spotify, alongside a recipe for a cuisine that has been chosen based on user input, or through random selection. The user can then store their favourite recipes and playlists to storage to be accessed when visiting next time.

## Features

- Dynamically generated HTML/CSS to load data based on user input
- AJAX calls to two server-side API's (Spotify & Spoonacular)
- Simple UI features to clearly layout functionality for the user to use
- Local storage to save user history


## Usage
When you are feeling indecisive or unknowledgeable about cooking a certain food/cuisine, use our application to look for recipes based on your input with a playlist to go with the theme.
